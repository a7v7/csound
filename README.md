# csound
All the csound libraries I can find.

## Background

I didn't write any of this. My goal since I've heard about Csound (back in the 90's) was to learn it. I've dabbled with Csound over the years but I have never mastered it. I have over the course of the years purchased several books, CD-ROMS, etc. This weekend I was trying to find the Amsterdam Catalog and couldn't find it on line. I thought that was strange. To me that's like losing the Mona Lisa. It may be somewhere in the wayback machine. But it wasn't immediately available.

So I went searching through my collection of CD-ROMs. I found the Amsterdam Catalog and a whole lot more. I'm posting this here publicly so anyone can access it.

## Licensing Note
   I did not create this content - it was distributed on CD-ROMs I purchased in the 1990s/2000s. 
   I'm making this available under an MIT license for maximum accessibility, but if any original 
   authors or copyright holders have concerns, please contact me and I'll update accordingly.

## Moving Forward

I'm going to move these catalogs forward to version 6.18 and hopefully version 7 when it becomes available. These will not be modified. I will create a separate repo for that.

If you have other historical Csound materials that are hard to find online, please consider contributing or creating similar repositories!
